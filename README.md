# CPUMedicalChatbot
We tried to  build a sophisticated Medical Chatbot using powerful open-source technologies such as Sentence Transformers for embeddings, Faiss CPU for vector storage, and integrate Llama 2, a large language model, using the Chainlit library for a conversational interface.
The Knowledge base is built with the 5 volumes of the Gale Encyclopedia of Medecine! :)
# What you need to do beforehand:
    1. Before you can start using the Langchain Medical Bot, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
    • Python 3.6 or higher
    • Required Python packages (you can install them using pip):
        ◦ langchain
        ◦ chainlit
        ◦ sentence-transformers
        ◦ faiss
        ◦ PyPDF2 (for PDF document loading)
    2. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
        • python -m venv venv
        • source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    3. Install the required Python packages:
        • pip install -r requirements.txt
